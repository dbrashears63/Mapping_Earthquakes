# Mapping Earthquakes

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to convey information by building insightful data visualizations with interactive features on all earthquakes and major earthquakes in the past 7 days from around the world. This is achieved by using the latest earthquake data from the U.S. Geological survey website. The data will be retrieved using JavaScript, D3.js, and Leaflet libraries. The data will be rendered using MapBox using an API request. 

## Coding and Data Resources

### Coding Resources
JavaScript	D3.js library
Leaflet.js	MapBox API

### Data Resources
U.S. Geological Survey earthquake data. Delivered in a GeoJSON format./

## Results

When the index.html is launched a map will render. A toggle box in the upper right-hand corner will allow the user to choose which underling map they wish to use and which layer of data they would display. In addition, popup markers were utilized so that when a user clicks on a circle which represents an earthquake it will display the magnitude and the location of that earthquake. The legend is in the lower right-hand corner. The colors represent the magnitude of the earthquake. 

## Images that represent the underlying maps and data

## Conclusion
Using data visualizations has the ability to show data in context as related to the question being asked. This project shows the relationship between the tectonic plates and where earthquakes occur. If someone is shown just the earthquake data it would be difficult for them to establish a correlation between tectonic plates and earthquakes.

Over all data visualizations enable users to grasp difficult concepts or identify new patterns. With interactive visualization as with this project the end user has the ability to see how the data changes by making changes to the visualization.
